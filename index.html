        <h1>What is Sigma Male?</h1>
        <p>
          A sigma male is a man who lives life based on his own rules, thriving
          for his passion, not distracted by societal norms or standards. He is
          his own boss, he doesn't need validation from anyone. By anyone, it
          means anyone literally, their ability to walk off from predefined and
          traditional norms. They don't restrict themselves like anyone or
          follow a conventional path, they create their own journey, choose
          their own struggles and build a path of their own. Society has a
          preset book of rules for everyone, while most of us stick to them due
          to the fear of being called out. Those who don’t come under the
          category of sigma. Sigma male meaning is not defined by the sigma
          males meme you see online, it is a broad category of males who are
          often referred to as lone wolfs; as they tend to be alone,
          companionship lowers their productivity. Before you make your own
          assumptions, let a get into a deep dive into what sigma males actually
          are. Sigma males are identified by their unique set of behavioral
          patterns, what is their attitude toward women, and their interests and
          goals.

        <h1>The Sigma Male Lifestyle</h1>
        <p>
          The societal hierarchy of men places the sigma below alpha males.
          Their lifestyle is often compared to that of a lone wolf, the one who
          stays on his own terms and goes on his own. He sets a path of his own,
          that is walking away from the pre-set rules. He denies surrendering to
          societal pressure and sticks to them. He follows a simple lifestyle;
          that is his own choice and his only priority is his goals and himself.
          Anything that takes him away from his goals, he cuts it. Nothing
          distracts him from achieving what he wants. What you desire is what
          makes you a sigma male. If you wanna know which category you fall
          into, you simply have to answer these questions. Do you like being the
          center of attention? Do you enjoy the power that comes with your
          status? Do you desire leadership or do you prefer getting a simple
          job? Do you find it difficult to connect with people or you are a
          social bird that loves talking to everyone and are eye candy? If you
          have a quality of a leader who makes his own rules and dedicatedly
          works towards achieving your goals. You are straightforward, simple,
          and like breaking traditional norms. Then you identify as a sigma
          male.

        <h1>Sigma Male v/s Alpha Male</h1>
        <p>
          An alpha male is a step higher than a sigma male owing to the
          abilities that keep people around him happy. He works with a tribe
          mentality, unlike a sigma who prefers to be on his own. The sigma male
          characteristics that set both of him apart from an alpha are: Alpha
          male Values his public image and how people perceive him Maintains the
          traditional norms of society and follows them Has a team and works
          well within them Extremely delighted and looking for opportunities for
          social interactions. Sigma male Works on pleasing only himself and
          doesn't bother others. Has his own norms and follows them Is a lone
          wolf and works alone. Occasionally makes a social presence, rather be
          alone than in a crowd. The alpha is the king and has to please people,
          unlike the sigma who has no reason to do the same. He doesn't want to
          be at the top of the hierarchy and dominate the alpha, he rather
          prefers being unnoticed and getting his work done.
