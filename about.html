            <h1>About Sigma Male</h1>
            <p>Sigma male is an internet slang and pseudoscientific term to describe masculine men. The term gained prominence within Internet culture during the late 2010s and early 2020s, and has inspired numerous memes, graffitis and videos. It is used to denote a male who is equally dominant to an alpha male, but exists outside the alpha-beta male hierarchy as a "lone wolf". In the manosphere, it is regarded as the "rarest" kind of male.
              The term first appeared in a blog post by American writer Vox Day. Later, California plastic surgeon John T. Alexander published the book The Sigma Male: What Women Really Want. In 2018, the term appeared on YouTube and in 2021 it went viral after a tweet by Lily Simpson.
              The term sigma male has also taken on an ironic and satirical meaning, sometimes mocking the concept of the "manosphere" and the ideas of hustle culture with bizarre and nonsensical actions being considered part of the sigma male mindset or "grindset". On social media, the term is often used to describe idealistic, masculine fictional characters from films and TV shows. Notably, actor Christian Bale's portrayal of the character Patrick Bateman from the 2000 film American Psycho is often cited as an ideal representation of a "sigma male", both through memes and unironic discussion.</p>

            <h1>Traits of Sigma Male</h1>
            <h5>A sigma male is well defined with the following traits:</h5>
              <h2>INDEPENDENCE</h2>
              <p class="para">One of the most important traits or character that a sigma male possess is his ability to depend only on himself. He is self-sufficient, he does all of his tasks and roles alone and doesn't need a helping hand. The quality that helps them the most is their adaptability to any situation, they are naturally good survivors and know how to take care of themselves, on their own without help. They provide for themselves, enjoy their own company, pay their own bills, and in short not rely on anyone other than themselves.</p><br>

            <div class="heading-1">
              <h2>I Am My Only Priority Rule</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="para">The essential trait of a sigma male personality is they only prioritize their own needs, goals, and comfort. His one priority is his goals, anything that seems to threaten his dreams, he is quick to throw it out. Be it a romantic relationship or a business partnership. His ultimate requirement out of anything is his own pleasure and benefits. If the relationship fails to serve the same, he won't think twice to break it off. Anything unworthy of his investment within a jiffy he walks away. This is how a sigma male prioritizes him over anyone.</p><br>
            <div class="heading-2">
              <h2>AVOIDING COMPANIONSHIP</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="para">One of the most important traits or character that a sigma male possess is his ability to depend only on himself. He is self-sufficient, he does all of his tasks and roles alone and doesn't need a helping hand. The quality that helps them the most is their adaptability to any situation, they are naturally good survivors and know how to take care of themselves, on their own without help. They provide for themselves, enjoy their own company, pay their own bills, and in short not rely on anyone other than themselves.</p><br>

            <div class="heading-3">
              <h2>CENTRE OF ATTENTION</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="para">A major thing that separates a sigma and an alpha are that a sigma never looks out for validation from others. He does not long for recognition from the crowd or be a people pleaser. His only focus is on what his goal is and how he can work towards achieving it. He is least bothered by what people perceive of him, do they like him or not. They would rather prefer living alone and work than be in the limelight for their work. They tend to possess the need to be invisible and work in their own peace.</p><br>
            <div class="heading-4">
              <h2>DEFYING SOCIAL NORMS</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="para">As it was mentioned above, a sigma never strives to follow traditional rules or patterns. He lives in his own mind, follows his own rules, and remains unbothered by society. He isn't disappointed by society or has ever been hurt by it by behaving in such a way. He is someone who simply never cared about it in the first place. Avoiding society is not his defense mechanism but a choice he made by simply not putting society above himself in any way. He simply won't change himself if he does not follow traditional rules.</p><br>
